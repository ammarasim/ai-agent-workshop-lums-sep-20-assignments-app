        Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. 
        This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves two main stages: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. 
        During light reactions, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and converts it into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. 
        The Calvin cycle uses this energy to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth 
        as it produces oxygen and serves as the foundation of most food chains. Factors affecting photosynthesis include light intensity, 
        carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature. Understanding photosynthesis is crucial for agriculture and environmental science.
